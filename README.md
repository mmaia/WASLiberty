# WASLiberty
Build a simple Liberty N.D configuration with 2 servers + IHS
The software used in this DockerFile requires IBM WebSphere N.D license. If you don't have I recommend that you take a look at the free Liberty version on Docker repository.

# Creating a Liberty Collective
The idea is to create and wire up 4 docker containers - 1 with Administration console, 1 with IHS and 2 with a Liberty Collective configured between them.
